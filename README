zeek-database-log
=================================

Log information about database connections including version and authentication information.

For now this only includes MySQL, but could be extended for PostgreSQL, too.


    zkg install https://github.com/awelzel/zeek-database-log


NOTE: This package requires a custom Zeek version. It does currently not
      work with Zeek 7.0 or before!
